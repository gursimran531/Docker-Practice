# 🐳 Docker & ☸️ Kubernetes Playground  

Welcome to my **Docker & Kubernetes Practice Repo**!  
This is where I experiment, break things, and build hands-on projects to sharpen my **Cloud, DevOps, and Container Orchestration** skills.  

---

## 📂 What you’ll find here  
- 🐳 **Docker Projects** → Images, containers, networks, and Compose setups.  
- ☸️ **Kubernetes Projects** → Pods, Services, Deployments, Ingress, Helm, and more.  
- ⚙️ **CI/CD Integrations** → Container workflows automated with pipelines.  
- 🔐 **Best Practices** → Security, resource limits, and multi-stage builds.  
- 📘 **Learning Notes** → My documented journey & lessons learned.  

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Docker** (Build, Ship, Run)  
- **Docker Compose** (Multi-container apps)  
- **Kubernetes** (Orchestration, scaling, deployments)  
- **Helm** (Package manager for k8s)  
- **Cloud Native Tools** → kind, minikube, kubectl, Skaffold  
- **CI/CD** → GitHub Actions  

---

## 📌 Goals of this Repo  
✅ Gain **hands-on containerization experience**  
✅ Build **real-world deployable apps**  
✅ Master **Kubernetes fundamentals**  
✅ Prepare for **DevOps & Cloud roles**  
✅ Share knowledge & reusable code with the community
